Exploratory analysis of DigiMV data

This is a preliminary and rather quick exploratory data analysis of the DigiMV data. It was created as part of the assessment during my job interview at NZa. 
The data is public and the most recent version (an earlier version is included in the repo) can be found here: https://www.jaarverantwoordingzorg.nl/gegevens-bekijken/verantwoordingsgegevens-per-verslagjaar-datasets.
You can view the html file, containing the slides I presented as part of the assessment, at https://kschouten.github.io/DigiMV/.

Obviously, everything here is based on public data only and any opinion is strictly my own.
